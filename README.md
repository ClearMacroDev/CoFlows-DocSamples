# CoFlows Documentation Samples

**CoFlows CE (Community Edition)** is a polyglot runtime that simplifies the development, hosting and deployment of powerful data-centric workflows. **CoFlows** enables developers to create rich **Web-APIs** with almost **zero boiler plate** and scheduled / reactive processes through a range of languages including CoreCLR (C#, F# and VB), JVM (Java and Scala), Python and Javascript. Furthermore, functions written in any of these languages can call each other within the same process with **full interop**.
